## ‚ùîAbout the game
*ReBattles2 is a continuation of the game series "ReBattles"*

It's Action-Fighting game where you fight with red stickman and he's whole army!

You can play limited Event Stages or discover 4 magic realms in Story Stages!

Use special abililites (like heal, berserk) to have bigger chance to win!

## üìñ Story
First version of the game was written in turbowarp ([scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) but better) by QwertyCode.

Then he with his friend Exisnate wanted to create a sequel for this game. On the beginning we tried with [phaser](https://phaser.io) but we realized it was pointless.

After the struggle we tried unity we started creating and later we realized, unity was too big for our project.

So, we switched to [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) and it had everythind what we needed and now we're creating game in this engine.

## üíª For curious developers
RB2 is using Godot v4.4 and written in GDScript (not C++, C# etc.)

Launcher is written in [Golang](https://go.dev) using [Wails](https://wails.io) framework.

In launcher's frontend we're using [vite](https://vite.dev) and [react](https://react.dev) framework and some ui library.
## ü§î Plans for the future
- more stages
- skins (some with custom animations)
- shop (pay with virtual money)
