## ‚ùîAbout the game
*ReBattles2 is a continuation of the game series "ReBattles"*

It's Action-Fighting game where you battle against red stickman and he's entire army!

Play limited-time Event Stages, or explore four magical realms in the Story Mode!

Use special abililites (like heal, berserk) to have bigger chance to win!

## üìñ Story
First version of the game was written in turbowarp ([scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) but better) by QwertyCode.

Then he with his friend Exisnate wanted to create a sequel for this game. At first, we tried using [Phaser](https://phaser.io), but soon realized it wasn't a good fit.

After some struggle, we switched to Unity and began development, but it turned out to be too heavy for our project.

So, we switched to [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) and it had everythind what we needed and now we're creating game in this engine.

## üíª For curious developers
ReBattles2 is built with Godot v4.4 and written entirely in GDScript (not C++, C#, etc.)

Launcher is written in [Golang](https://go.dev) using [Wails](https://wails.io) framework.

In launcher's frontend we're using [vite](https://vite.dev) and [react](https://react.dev) framework and some ui library.
## ü§î Plans for the future
- More Stages
- Unlockable Skins
